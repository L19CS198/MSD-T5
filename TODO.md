# TODO List for Express.js Books API

- [x] Create package.json with Express dependency
- [x] Create books.json with initial sample data
- [x] Create server.js implementing all endpoints (GET /books, POST /books, PUT /books/:id, DELETE /books/:id, GET /books/available) using fs for file operations
- [x] Implement error handling for invalid IDs and file issues
- [x] Run npm install to install dependencies
- [x] Run node server.js to start the server
- [x] Test the endpoints manually (e.g., using curl or Postman)
